## 📌 Goals
- Contribute consistently to Julia and official packages.  
- Document PRs, issues, and closed tickets.  
- Gain experience in open source and GitHub. 

---

## 🛠️ Tracking Method
- Every time I open a PR → I record it here immediately (even if not merged yet).  
- When merged → I update the status from `Open` to `Merged`.  
- I add notes on what I’ve learned from each contribution.
